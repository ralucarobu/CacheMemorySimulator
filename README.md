# Cache Memory Simulator

An interactive **Cache Memory Simulator** that models the behavior of cache memory in modern computer architectures.

## Features
- Direct, Associative, Set-Associative mapping
- LRU, LFU, Random replacement policies
- Write-Through and Write-Back policies
- Hit/Miss rate calculation
- Written in C++

## Technologies
- C++
- Visual Studio
- OOP Principles

## How It Works
1. Simulates RAM and Cache.
2. Custom configuration for cache parameters.
3. Provides insight on cache hit/miss rates.
4. Visualizes cache performance under different policies.

##  Usage
- Clone the repo
- Open in Visual Studio
- Configure cache settings in the UI or code
- Run simulations and check performance
